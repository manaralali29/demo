# De-Pollute Vision 
---
## An object detection model that detects visual pollution.

This project aims to propose a model that can accurately identify different types of visual pollution. This model will contribute to the future development of cities in Saudi Arabia that face the problem of visual pollution, and enhance the overall well-being of the population.

## How to install and implement De-Pollute Vision

The easiest way to do this (to see the final output) would be to run the 'yolov5.zip' containing the interface package and best-performing model. You can directly input any image, even outside the dataset to test the model. But, here's a step-by-step guide on how to develop this project: 

1. Have a Google Drive, and install Google Colaboratory
   
2. In your drive, create a folder (directory) called 'Dataset' and upload the dataset from SDAIA using the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ULqYtd9yomeGz53WBhgRdPRFB37ppeDU/view
